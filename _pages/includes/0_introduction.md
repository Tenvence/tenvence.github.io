I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Nanjing University under the supervision of Professor [Qing Gu (顾庆)](https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html) and Assistant Professor [Zhiwei Jiang (蒋智威)](https://zhiweinju.github.io).
Additionally, I am currently a visiting Ph.D. student at Singapore Management University, where I am guided by Associate Professor [Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com) and Assistant Professor [Jiannan Li](https://jchrisli.github.io), with funding from the China Scholarship Council (CSC).

I have a broad interest in computer vision and deep learning, with a current focus on controllable and consistent generation in AIGC, including *audio-driven video generation* and *text-to-image generation*.

From May 2023 to May 2024, I was a research intern at Tencent AI Lab, where I worked under the mentorship of Kuan Tian (田宽) and Jun Zhang (张军), concentrating on research in AIGC.
