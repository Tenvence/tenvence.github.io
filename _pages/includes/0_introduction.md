I am working for Ph.D. degree in Nanjing University with Prof. [Qing Gu](https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html) and Assistant Professor [Zhiwei Jiang](https://zhiweinju.github.io).
Currently, I am also a research intern at Tencent AI Lab, mentored by [Kuan Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zZeo7hwAAAAJ) and [Jun Zhang](https://junzhang.org).  

I possess a wide-ranging interest in computer vision and deep learning. 
Currently, my focus is on **the controlled and consistent generation within AIGC**, such as the tasks of *audio-driven video generation*, *stylized image generation*, and so on.
In addition, I am also deeply invested in exploring **model architecture within AIGC**, particularly the techniques involved in *ensembling* and *merging*.
My prior research experience spans various fields, including essay scoring, ordinal classification, and object detection, to name a few.

My B.Eng. degree was received from Nanjing Institute of Technology in June 2019. 
In the same year, I was admitted to study for M.Eng. degree in Nanjing University.
